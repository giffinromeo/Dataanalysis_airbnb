1. Understanding the Business
2. Understanding the Data
3. Preparing the Data
4. Modeling the Data
5. Evaluating the Results
6. Deploying the Solution

Installation
The necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python are stated below. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.6.
* numpy 
* pandas 
* matplotlib.pyplot
* sklearn.linear_model 
* sklearn.model_selection
* sklearn.metrics
* seaborn 
* matplotlib
* scipy.stats
* statsmodels.api
* scipy

Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Data to better understand the following points:

* For travelers: Is it worthwhile to choose an Airbnb unit hosted by a superhost?
* For market analysis: How has Airbnb evolved in Seattle, and are there any noticeable trends or patterns?
* For investors: What are the key factors to consider for maximizing the performance of an Airbnb unit?

File Descriptions
There is a jupyter notebook containing the whole code used for the analysis. In addition to that we have the source data files used for the same.

Results

The significant findings and the interpretation are being displayed on the post published here in this link ().
